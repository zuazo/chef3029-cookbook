CHEF-3029 Cookbook
==================

This is a cookbook for testing the following Opscode ticket:

* [CHEF-3029: ifconfig provider for debian/ubuntu platforms](http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3029)

It tests the `ifconfig` resource against `Debian` and `Ubuntu` using [test-kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen).

The vagrant boxes are publicly downloadable, see the [kitchen.yml](https://github.com/onddo/chef3029-cookbook/tree/master/.kitchen.yml) file. This boxes have a **non-stable version of Chef** 11.4.0 from [the last Pull Request on the ticket](https://github.com/btm/chef/pull/1) (2013-05-24).

It is recommended to look at [the used recipe](https://github.com/onddo/chef3029-cookbook/tree/master/recipes/default.rb) and the [tests](https://github.com/onddo/chef3029-cookbook/tree/master/test/integration/default/bats/).
